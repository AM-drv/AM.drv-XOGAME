About this code for the game XO
I used AI to help me write codes 
I asked Ai to write me this code and I modify it like colors 
And as a start - TEST - I wrote the code and created an html file
And then I hosted the file here at Github. 
I don't have much understanding of codes 
But this step made me learn how to modify simple things in the code such as color
And also create and host an html file
Now I have learned how to create an html file, which took me 2 hours to write the code 
Because I didn't understand how it was created at first until it turned out that the reason was that I had to add(.)
My mistake was that I write the file after formatting like this ðŸ‘‡
Usernamehtml
And the right is ðŸ‘‰ Username.html
What made me laugh is that I try for 2 hours and it didn't work until I knew my mistake
But it was my beginning to understand how to create html files truth 
( I'm sorry if the game doesn't look good, I didn't care much about the format because my goal was only to experiment and test)
